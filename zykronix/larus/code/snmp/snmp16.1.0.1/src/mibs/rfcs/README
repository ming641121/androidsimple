The files in this directory include a set of RFCs which either are MIB
documents, are of general interest or which directly relate to
management of networks, applications or systems in some other way.
These are provided as a service to SNMP Research's customers.

The file INDEX contains a portion of the RFC index which pertains to
the files included here.  While we attempt to keep this list
up-to-date, that is virtually impossible given the pace of MIB
development in the Internet community.  Please check the most recent
version of the RFC index to be certain that an RFC included here has
not been obsoleted.

Online copies of RFCs are available from http://www.ietf.org.
