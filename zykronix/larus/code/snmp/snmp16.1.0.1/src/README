STRUCTURE OF THE DISTRIBUTION

  Makefile:
    The top level makefile.
    The default makefiles are Makefile, Makefile.1, and Makefile.1c.
    Note, that if there is more than one operating system, then each
    operating system has its own set of makefiles in addition to the default
    makefiles(Makefile.(os), Makev1.(os), and Makev1c.(os)).

  README:
    This file.

  config: 
    The system configuration files needed for running the agents.
    They should reside in the /etc directory.

  doc: Manpages, release notes, and other online documentation
    can be found in subdirectories under the doc directory.  This documentation
    is divided into two subsections: doc/devel is a subdirectory containing
    developer documentation, the release of which to third parties is
    restricted; doc/user contains user documentation which is suitable for
    use in the development of documentation for third parties.

  (os).bin:
    Directory for binaries.


  get*,setany,trap:
    SNMP command-line manager utilities for use with the agent.

  (os).lib:
    Directory for libraries.

  mibtools:
    SNMP MIB compiler along with a selection of MIBs for your 
    compiling enjoyment.

  snmpd:
    SNMP agent source directory.

BEFORE YOU BEGIN

  There are some things you should know before you begin:

  Format of the Distribution

  Privileges

    Installing the configuration files may require root privileges.
    If you do not have root privileges, arrange for them before you
    continue.
 
    Running the agent requires root privileges since the agent needs
    exclusive access to a privileged port (161, 162 if traps are sent).


  Configuration Files

    There is a set of configuration files (in directory
    config).  By default, these will be placed in the
    /etc/srconf directory of your system in a "make install".  You can
    install them separately if necessary.

    Also, in config/agt/snmpd.cnf, the transportAddress
    and the transportReceiveMask in the transportEntry section need to
    be changed to the correct values for the current network.



  System Requirements

    Make sure the SNMP ports are defined in your system services.
    I.e., check the /etc/services file on your system for the entries

	snmp            161/udp
	snmp-trap       162/udp

    If they are not there, add these services.

    Only one agent may have access to port 161 at a time, therefore
    only one agent may be running at any time.  


DOCUMENTATION

  Documentation on the use of the utilities can be found in the man
  subdirectory doc/user/manpages/commands; library manual
  pages can be found in the doc/devel/manpages/libs
  subdirectory; configuration file-format manual pages can be found in
  the doc/user/manpages/formats subdirectory.  If you do not
  wish to install the man pages on your system, you may use nroff to view
  them; e.g.,

	nroff -man manfilename | more

  will display the man page "manfilename" (say, getbulk.man) as
  a properly formatted manual page.  Alternatively, you may generate
  text files for manpages using the Maketxt makefile provided in the
  doc/tools subdirectory.


COMPILE WARNINGS
  Below is a list of warnings that we were unable to resolve at release time.
  These warnings can be safely ignored.
